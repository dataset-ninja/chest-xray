**Chest Xray Masks and Labels** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. It is used in the medical industry. 

The dataset consists of 896 images with 1627 labeled objects belonging to 2 different classes including *healthy lung* and *tuberculosis lung*.

Images in the Chest Xray Masks and Labels dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. There are 192 (21% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *CXRpng-train* (800 images) and *test* (96 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 2 origins of data: <span style="background-color: #ecdefc; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px;">Montgomery County</span> (138 images) and <span style="background-color: #ecdefc; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px;">Shenzhen</span> (662 images). The dataset was released in 2019 by the National Institutes of Health, USA, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, China, and The Shenzhen No. 3 People's Hospital, China.
