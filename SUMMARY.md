**Chest Xray Masks and Labels** is a dataset for instance segmentation tasks. It is used in the medical industry.

The dataset consists of 800 images with 278 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*lung*).

Each image in the Chest Xray Masks and Labels dataset has pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. There are 662 (83% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There is 1 split in the dataset: *ds* (800 images). The dataset was released in 2019.

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
