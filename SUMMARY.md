**Chest Xray Masks and Labels** is a dataset for semantic segmentation and object detection tasks. It is used in the medical industry. 

The dataset consists of 800 images with 278 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*lung*).

Images in the Chest Xray Masks and Labels dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the semantic segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into an object detection (bounding boxes for every object) task. There are 662 (83% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2019 by the [undefined](undefined).

Here are the visualized examples for each of the 1 classes:
